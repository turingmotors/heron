Welcome to "heron" repository. Heron is a library that seamlessly integrates multiple Vision and Language models, as well as Video and Language models. One of its standout features is its support for Japanese V&L models. Additionally, we provide pretrained weights trained on various datasets.

Heron allows you to configure your own V&L models combining various modules. Vision Encoder, Adopter, and LLM can be configured in the configuration file. The distributed learning method and datasets used for training can also be easily configured.

# Installation
## 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/turingmotors/heron.git
cd heron
```

## 2. Install Packages
We recommend using virtual environment to install the required packages. If you want to install the packages globally, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` instead.
### 2-a. Poetry (Recommended)
Using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), you can install the required packages as follows:
```bash
# install pyenv environment
pyenv install 3.10
pyenv local 3.10

# install packages from pyproject.toml
poetry install

# install local package
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .

# for development, install pre-commit
pre-commit install
``````

### 2-b. Anaconda
Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), you can install the required packages as follows:
```bash
conda create -n heron python=3.10 -y
conda activate heron
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# for development, install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## 3. Resister for Llama-2 models
To use Llama-2 models, you need to register for the models.
First, you request access to the llama-2 models, in [huggingface page](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b) and [facebook website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)

Please sign-in the HuggingFace account.
```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

# Training

Now we support LLaMA, MPT, and OPT as a LLM module.

```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```

# Evaluation

You can get the pretrained weight form HuggingFace Hub: [Inoichan/GIT-Llama-2-7B](https://huggingface.co/Inoichan/GIT-Llama-2-7B)<br>

# prepare a pretrained model
model = GitLlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained('Inoichan/GIT-Llama-2-7B')
model.eval()
model.to(f"cuda:{device_id}")

# prepare a processor
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained('Inoichan/GIT-Llama-2-7B')

# prepare inputs

image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

text = f"##Instruction: Please answer the following question concretely. ##Question: What is unusual about this image? Explain precisely and concretely what he is doing? ##Answer: "

# do preprocessing
inputs = processor(
    text,
    image,
    return_tensors="pt",
    truncation=True,
)
inputs = {k: v.to(f"cuda:{device_id}") for k, v in inputs.items()}

# set eos token
eos_token_id_list = [
    processor.tokenizer.pad_token_id,
    processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
]

# do inference
with torch.no_grad():
    out = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=256, do_sample=False, temperature=0., eos_token_id=eos_token_id_list)

# print result
print(processor.tokenizer.batch_decode(out))
```
